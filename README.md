This repository contains the source code for a simple Tic Tac Toe game Android app. The app allows two players to play the classic Tic Tac Toe game on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns to place their symbols ('X' or 'O') on the grid, and the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If no player achieves this, the game results in a draw after all nine positions are filled.

4. The first player is represented by 'X', and the second player is represented by 'O'.
5. The game will notify players if there's a winner or if the game ends in a draw.
